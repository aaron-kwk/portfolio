Read this book for the first time in HS. Re-read it recently.
I don&apos;t really read a lot of books, so its imagery stuck out in my memory. 

It didn&apos;t disappoint. I remember relating to the solitude that Holden felt when he was stuck in Manhattan all alone. 
He didn&apos;t feel like seeing people more than once, but he also got too restless and depressed being stuck in his hotel room, 
so there are a couple scenes of him wandering through the streets of a wintry New York, quietly observing all the 
things around him that came off as amusing or bizarre in the dead-quiet emptiness of the night.

I remember this same feeling of self-imposed loneliness from back when my mother first passed away, and I think I really resonated with the fact that
Holden was my age and that he felt out of place. I wasn&apos;t the only one who felt that way back then, but in my isolation it helped to know that
at least one other person was out there who had felt the same way I did and wrote this story.
